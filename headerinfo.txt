//This is a header file generated using the auto header generation python script
// it uses the xml netlist generated by KiCAD
// every part having a custom field named as "header" and the value of that as the file name and path
//for eg. header: myproject/src/hardware.hardware
//it is not guranteed that the file will build with your source,
// as the pin names are generated from the kicad library, make sure that the name for the pin of you uC
// is the same for both the KiCAD library and the pin defininations header file included
